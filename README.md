# A-Blocks
Block based coding for A-Frame.

A-Blocks is a part of my honours dissertation at the University of Western Australia. The aim is to look into engagement and if adding 3D/VR improves it. Feel free to have a play around with it and give feedback/report issues.

This uses A-frame for the graphics and Blockly for the coding interface.
